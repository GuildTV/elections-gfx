## An apology
First off, I would like to apologise for the mess that is this code. It is a huge abuse of react.js and a complete mess.

Our excuse is that it was the first time we had both used react, and we didn't really know what we were doing. I see no point in fixing that because it works, and I don't fancy what would essentially be writing the whole thing from scratch.
